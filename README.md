Welloculus works like a medical assistant, a care taker and a well-wisher for its Mobile Application users by keeping a keen eye on their health statistics, constantly monitoring the fluctuations from normal behavior and providing medical aid in an emergency situation. See how it helped Mr. Joy on time and prevented the situation from becoming worse and panicking for him and his family.
